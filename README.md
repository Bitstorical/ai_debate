# AI Debate Simulator

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **AI Debate Simulator**, where two powerful LLMs—**Llama3.2** and **Mistral**—go head-to-head in a structured debate while you moderate the discussion! The models exchange arguments based on a given topic, adopting unique **personalities** and facing fun **challenges** for an engaging and unpredictable debate. 

## 🎯 Features
- **Choose Your AI Debaters**: Select which model takes the **Pro** or **Contra** side (L for Llama, M for Mistral).
- **Live Argument Exchange**: Each AI responds to the opponent's last argument, ensuring a continuous discussion.
- **Personalities & Challenges**: Add spice with roles like **'a sarcastic comedian'** or constraints like **'use only historical facts'**.
- **Threaded Execution**: Both models run independently in **separate threads via Ollama**, ensuring smooth operation.
- **Simple Terminal Interface**: Type a topic and moderate the debate round-by-round!
